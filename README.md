# CTF-Writeups

This repository contains a collection of Capture The Flag (CTF) writeups, where I document my solutions and strategies for various CTF challenges. These challenges cover a wide range of topics, including web security, cryptography, reverse engineering, forensics, and more.
You can also check them at my [Notion blog](https://e-ctf-writeups.notion.site/CTF-WRITEUPS-a6db871b6e204ceb8c51cc0413423580)

## Introduction

CTF competitions are cybersecurity events that involve solving challenges related to different areas of information security. These challenges are designed to test participants' knowledge, problem-solving skills, and ability to think outside the box. Writeups serve as documentation of the solutions and thought processes used to solve these challenges.

This repository aims to provide detailed explanations and step-by-step walkthroughs for the CTF challenges I have completed. By sharing my writeups, I hope to contribute to the community and help others learn from my experiences.

## CTF Challenges

The CTF challenges covered in this repository include, but are not limited to:

- Web security
- Cryptography
- Reverse engineering
- Forensics
- Steganography
- Exploitation
- Network analysis
- Binary exploitation
- Mobile app security
- and more...

Each challenge writeup typically includes the following sections:

- Challenge description and category
- Initial analysis and observations
- Solution approach and thought process
- Detailed step-by-step guide to solving the challenge
- Final solution and flag extraction

That's it! You're now ready to explore the CTF writeups.
